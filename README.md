# Hi 👋 My name is Ashfakur Rahaman

## Data & Business Analyst | Excel, SQL, Power BI & Python Expert | MSc Data Analytics | Industrial and Production Engineer | Demand Forecasting & Reporting Automation | Logistics & Supply Chain Optimization |

I am a solution-oriented Junior Data Analyst with a focus on data-driven decisions. Seeking a position in Berlin or Brandenburg. With my MSc in Data Analytics (BSBI Berlin, 2024) and experience in logistics optimization (e.g., 25% efficiency increase through KPI dashboards at Berlin Last Mile), I bring skills in Excel (Advanced: Pivot Tables, Automation), Power BI (KPI Visualization), Python (Basic: Pandas, Scripting), SQL, and Demand Forecasting.

In my Master's thesis, I developed forecasting models (Exponential Smoothing, Moving Average, ANN) for pharma inventory, achieving MAPE of 9.65-13.18% – integrated with customer survey data for better accuracy. Previous roles at Growthonics (generated 8,900+ B2B leads, 50% time savings through Google Sheets scripts) and Gorillas (95% inventory accuracy) have shown me how data optimizes supply chains.

I am team-oriented, eager to learn, and multilingual (English C1, German A2 – currently B1 course). Hobby: Small programming projects in data analysis. Let's connect for data roles in Germany!
